## Chapter `05` | Bit Manipulation

### [5.1: Insertion](../src/05/01/main.cpp) `./ctci6 05 01`
- You are given two `32-bit` numbers, `N` and `M`, and two bit positions, `i` and `j`. <br>Write a method to insert `M` into `N` such that `M` starts at bit `j` and ends at bit `i`. <p>You can assume that the bits `j` through `i` have enough space to fit all of `M`. <p>That is, if `M = 10011`,<br>you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between `j` and `i`. <p>You would not, for example, have `j = 3` and `i = 2`,<br>because `M` could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.

    EXAMPLE<br>
    ```
    Input:  N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
    Output: N = 10001001100
    ```

### [5.2: Binary to String](../src/05/02/main.cpp) `./ctci6 05 02`
- Given a real number between `0` and `1` (e.g., `0.72`) that is passed in as a `double`, print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most `32` characters, print "`ERROR`".

### [5.3: Flip Bit to Win](../src/05/03/main.cpp) `./ctci6 05 03`
- You have an integer and you can flip exactly one bit from a `0` to a `1`.<br>Write code to find the length of the longest sequence of `1`'s you could create.

    EXAMPLE<br>
    ```
    Input:      1775    (or: 11011101111)
    Output:     8
    ```

### [5.4: Next Number](../src/05/04/main.cpp) `./ctci6 05 04`
- Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.

### [5.5: Debugger](../src/05/05/main.cpp) `./ctci6 05 05`
- Explain what the following code does: `((n & (n - 1)) == 0)`

### [5.6: Conversion](../src/05/06/main.cpp) `./ctci6 05 06`
- Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B.

    EXAMPLE<br>
    ```
    Input:      29 (or: 11101), 15 (or: 01111)
    Output:     2
    ```
### [5.7: Pairwise Swap](../src/05/07/main.cpp) `./ctci6 05 07`
- Write a program to swap off and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e.g. bit `0` and bit `1` are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on).

### [5.8: Draw Line](../src/05/08/main.cpp) `./ctci6 05 08)`
- A monochrome screen is stored as singly array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. <p>The screen has width `w`, where `w` is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array and the width. <p>Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from `(x1, y)` to (`x2, y)` <p>The method signature should look something like:<br> <code>drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y)</code>
