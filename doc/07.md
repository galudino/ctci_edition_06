## Chapter `07` | Object-Oriented Design

### [7.1: Deck of Cards](../src/07/01/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 01`
- Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.
  
### [7.2: Call Center](../src/07/02/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 02`
- Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, and director. <p>An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. <p>If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. <p>If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. <p>Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method `dispatchCall()` which assigns a call to the first available employee.

### [7.3: Jukebox](../src/07/03/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 03`
- Design a musical jukebox using object-oriented principles.
  
### [7.4: Parking Lot](../src/07/04/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 04`
- Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles.

### [7.5: Online Book Reader](../src/07/05/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 05`
- Design the data structures for an online book reader system.

### [7.6: Jigsaw](../src/07/06/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 06`
- Implement an `(N x N)` jigsaw puzzle. Design the data structures and explain an algorithm to solve the puzzle. <p>You can assume that you have a `fitsWith` method which, when passed two puzzle edges, returns true if the two edges belong together.

### [7.7: Chat Server](../src/07/07/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 07`
- Explain how you would design a chat server. In particular, provide details about the various backend components, classes, and methods. What would be the hardest problems to solve?

### [7.8: Othello](../src/07/08/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 08`
- Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other.<p>When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides, or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped.<p>On your turn, you must capture at least one of your opponent's pieces. <p>The game ends when either user has no more valid moves. The win is assigned to the person with the most pieces. <p>Implement the object-oriented design for Othello.

### [7.9: Circular Array](../src/07/09/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 09`
- Implement a `CircularArray` class that supports an array-like data structure which can be efficiently rotated. <p>If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a `template`), and should support iteration via the standard for `(Obj o : circularArray)` notation.

### [7.10: Minesweeper](../src/07/10/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 10`
- Design and implement a text-based Minesweeper game. <p>Minesweeper is the classic single-player computer game where an `(N x N)` grid has B mines (or bombs) hidden across the grid. <p>The remaining cells are either blank or have a number behind them. <p>The numbers reflect the number of bombs in the surrounding eight cells. <p>The user then uncovers a cell. <p>If it is a bomb, the player loses. <br>If it is a number, the number is exposed. <br>If it is a blank cell, this cell and all adjacent blank cells (up to and including the surrounding numeric cells) are exposed. <p>The player wins when all non-bomb cells are exposed. <p>The player can also flag certain places as potential bombs. This doesn't affect game play, other than to block the user from accidentally clicking a cell that is thought to have a bomb. <p>(Tip for the reader: if you're not familiar with this game, please playa few rounds online first.)

### [7.11: File System](../src/07/11/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 11`
- Explain the data structures and algorithms that you would use to design an in-memory file system. Illustrate with an example in code where possible.

### [7.12: Hash Table](../src/07/12/main.cpp) `./ctci6 07 12`
- Design and implement a hash table which uses chaining (linked lists) to handle collisions.
