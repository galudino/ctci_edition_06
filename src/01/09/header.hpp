    \brief      Header file for CTCI (6th Edition), question 1.8: Zero Matrix

    \details
    Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of another.
    Given two strings, s1 and s2, 
    write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 
    using only one call to isSubstring 
    (e.g.,"waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").
