    \brief      Source file for CTCI (6th Edition), question 1.5: One Away

    \details
    There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: 
    insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character.

    Given two strings, 
    write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.

    EXAMPLE

    pale,  ple  -> true
    pales, pale -> true
    pale,  bale -> true
    pale,  bake -> false
