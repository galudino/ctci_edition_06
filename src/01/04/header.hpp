    \brief      Header file for CTCI (6th Edition), question 1.4: Palindrome Permutation

    \details
    Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. 
    A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 
    A permutation is a rearrangment of letters. 
    The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

    EXAMPLE

    Input: Tact Coa
    Output: true (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)
