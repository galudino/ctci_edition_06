    \brief      Source file for CTCI (6th Edition), question 1.3: URLify

    \details
    Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20`. 
    You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, 
    and that you are given the "true" length of the string.

    (Note: If implementing in Java, 
    please use a character array 
    so that you can perform this operation in place.)
