    \brief      Source file for CTCI (6th Edition), question 2.3: Delete Middle Node

    \details
    Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle 
    (i.e. any node but the first and the last node, 
    not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, 
    given only access to that node.

    EXAMPLE
    Input: the node c from the linked list 
        a->b->c->d->e->f

    Result: nothing is returned, 
    but the new linked list looks like 
        a->b->d->e->f
